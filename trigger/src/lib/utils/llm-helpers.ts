// This file previously contained LLM helper functions that have been replaced
// by direct agent calls with structured output in the Trigger.dev tasks.
// 
// The following functions were removed as they are now redundant:
// - extractJobRequirementsWithLLM (now done in analyzeJobDescription task)
// - calculateMatchScoreWithLLM (now done in analyzeJobDescription task)
// - extractRelevantExperienceWithLLM (now handled by agent directly)
//
// If you need similar functionality, use the agents directly with structured output.
